### Number Guessing Game Question Statement:

You are tasked with creating a simple Number Guessing Game in Python. The game should **generate a random number** between a specified range (for example, 1 to 100), and the player has to guess the correct number.

**Game Rules:**

1. The game should welcome the player and explain the rules.
2. The computer randomly selects a number within a predefined range.
3. The player is prompted to guess the number.
4. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
5. The player continues guessing until they correctly identify the number.
6. The game displays the number of attempts it took for the player to guess correctly.
7. Additional Requirements:

Implement the game using Python programming language.
Use the **random** module to generate a random number.

Display informative messages to guide the player during the game.

Allow the player to play the game multiple times if they wish.

##### **Optional Enhancements:**

- Add difficulty levels with different ranges for the random number.
- Implement a scoring system based on the number of attempts.
